Plays audio and makes it REALLY hard to stop!

## How to use
DOWNLOAD **ALL** FILES INTO THE SAME FOLDER

Run `installpckgs.py` to install the required packages. Uses a hack to force pip to still work with untrusted SSL certificates.
You can rename `hiddenaudioplayer.pyw` but not the image as that is a dependency!
The image file has hidden content including some audio that the player depends on!
